{"name":"Fluid Grid","body":"# Fluid Grid\r\n\r\n## What is it? \r\n\r\nFluid, Responsive and Semantic grid is built for LESS CSS. It supports any number \r\nof columns. Gutter width is defined as percentage (rendered as left margin), and \r\ngrids can be nested too. \r\n\r\n## Requirements for a reusable, fast and flexible grid system\r\n\r\nI believe a CSS grid system should meet the following requirements so that it can \r\nbe used as a reusable build tool in every project:\r\n\r\n* Flexible, supporting any number of columns and gutter widths, as required by the \r\n\tdesign (I don't want any default grid)\r\n* Allows fast grid prototyping (requires CSS preprocessor)\r\n* Fluid, percentage-based (fixed width grids can be easily generated by giving \r\n\tthe containing row a fixed width, if needed)\r\n* Responsive, mobile first approach, applying the grid only if there's enough screen \r\n\testate\r\n* Nested but keeping the same root grid classes (I want to able to split the container \r\n\trow by the number of columns the container has; it doesn't make sense to have class \r\n\t\"grid-6\" inside a parent that has a class \"grid-6\" if I want to split that \r\n\tparent in two. Instead, I want to use the same class than in the root level: \"grid-3\". \r\n\tThis is different than what the Twitter Bootstrap or ZURB Foundation currently \r\n\tdo).\r\n* Backwards compatible, cross-browser support (preferably incl. IE7+), no JavaScript \r\n\tdependancies\r\n* Right to Left language support easily added\r\n* Ability to decide whether to use unsemantic \".grid-x\" classes, or my own.\r\n\r\nSo basically what we have here is The Semantic Grid (http://semantic.gs/) and Trevor \r\nDavis' Sass & Compass Grid (http://viget.com/inspire/building-a-nested-responsive-grid-with-sass-compass) \r\nmerged together (in LESS CSS).\r\n\r\n##Credits \r\n\r\nThis grid system wouldn't exist without the many existing awesome grid frameworks. \r\nSee the credit section in grid.less. \r\n\r\nI'm also using here Nicolas Gallagher's Mobile first CSS and getting Sass to help with \r\nlegacy IE technique (http://nicolasgallagher.com/mobile-first-css-sass-and-ie/), \r\nin LESS CSS, to serve the same grid for oldIE (<IE9) that don't support @media queries. \r\nIE has min-width specified so the grid is fluid only until that point. More capable \r\nbrowsers get the responsive version. \r\n\r\nThere are many grids, but I use this one because it gives me the flexibility I need. \r\nGive it a try, to see if it can help streamlining your workflow too.","tagline":"Fluid, Responsive and Semantic grid for LESS CSS.
