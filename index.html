<h2>What is it?</h2>

<p>Fluid, Responsive and Semantic grid is built for LESS CSS. It supports any number 
of columns. Gutter width is defined as percentage (rendered as left margin), and 
grids can be nested too. </p>

<h2>Requirements for a reusable, fast and flexible grid system</h2>

<p>I believe a CSS grid system should meet the following requirements so that it can 
be used as a reusable build tool in every project:</p>

<ul>
<li>Flexible, supporting any number of columns and gutter widths, as required by the 
design (I don't want any default grid)</li>
<li>Allows fast grid prototyping (requires CSS preprocessor)</li>
<li>Fluid, percentage-based (fixed width grids can be easily generated by giving 
the containing row a fixed width, if needed)</li>
<li>Responsive, mobile first approach, applying the grid only if there's enough screen 
estate</li>
<li>Nested but keeping the same root grid classes (I want to able to split the container 
row by the number of columns the container has; it doesn't make sense to have class 
"grid-6" inside a parent that has a class "grid-6" if I want to split that 
parent in two. Instead, I want to use the same class than in the root level: "grid-3". 
This is different than what the Twitter Bootstrap or ZURB Foundation currently 
do).</li>
<li>Backwards compatible, cross-browser support (preferably incl. IE7+), no JavaScript 
dependancies</li>
<li>Right to Left language support easily added</li>
<li>Ability to decide whether to use unsemantic ".grid-x" classes, or my own.</li>
</ul><p>So basically what we have here is The Semantic Grid (<a href="http://semantic.gs/">http://semantic.gs/</a>) and Trevor 
Davis' Sass &amp; Compass Grid (<a href="http://viget.com/inspire/building-a-nested-responsive-grid-with-sass-compass">http://viget.com/inspire/building-a-nested-responsive-grid-with-sass-compass</a>) 
merged together (in LESS CSS).</p>

<h2>Credits</h2>

<p>This grid system wouldn't exist without the many existing awesome grid frameworks. 
See the credit section in grid.less. </p>

<p>I'm also using here Nicolas Gallagher's Mobile first CSS and getting Sass to help with 
legacy IE technique (<a href="http://nicolasgallagher.com/mobile-first-css-sass-and-ie/">http://nicolasgallagher.com/mobile-first-css-sass-and-ie/</a>), 
in LESS CSS, to serve the same grid for oldIE (&lt;IE9) that don't support <a href="https://github.com/media" class="user-mention">@media</a> queries. 
IE has min-width specified so the grid is fluid only until that point. More capable 
browsers get the responsive version. </p>

<p>There are many grids, but I use this one because it gives me the flexibility I need. 
Give it a try, to see if it can help streamlining your workflow too.</p>
